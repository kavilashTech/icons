        <p style="text-align:left">Structural integrity of engineering components and structures in power, defense, aerospace and chemical industries is of importance as it affects the performance, durability, reliability, safety and economy of operations. The structural integrity as a whole is a multidisciplinary domain encompassing mechanical design, stress analysis, material selection, characterization, fabrication processes, environmental effects, non-destructive evaluation, failure analysis and quality assurance.</p>
        <p>ICONS 2023 will be the third in a series of International Conferences on Structural Integrity and will be held during 23-25, August 2023. The conference aims to bring together the multi- disciplinary community of engineers, scientists, academicians, industry experts, plant managers and regulatory personnel to discuss the recent trends and future directions in structural integrity. The scope of ICONS 2023 includes, but is not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mechanical behaviour of materials, experimental, computational and analytical methods in fatigue and fracture assessment, failure analysis</li>
          <li>Fatigue and fracture mechanics of metals, composites, bio and nano materials, steel and concrete structures.</li>
          <li>Creep and creep-fatigue interaction, environmental effects</li>
          <li>Structural health and condition monitoring & non-destructive evaluation</li>
          <li>In-service inspection, remote handling and robotics</li>
          <li>Reliability, risk assessment</li>
          <li>Regulatory aspects, development of test standards, design codes and standards, fracture based design and analysis on structural integrity</li>
          <li>Remaining life assessment and extension damage mechanics</li>
          <li>Offshore and marine structures</li>
          <li>Aerospace and automobile applications</li>
        </ul>
