        <p style="text-align:left">ICONS 2023 is being jointly organized by the <strong>Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research </strong>(IGCAR, Kalpakkam, India,<span><a href="http://www.igcar.gov.in" target="_blank">http://www.igcar.gov.in</a></span>), the <strong>Society for Failure Analysis (SFA)</strong>, <span><a href="http://www.sfaindia.org" target="_blank">http://www.sfaindia.org</a></span>) together with <strong>Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai</strong>, <strong>Indian Institute of Metals (IIM)</strong>, <strong>Indian Structural Integrity Society (InSIS)</strong> and <strong>Indian Society for Non-destructive Testing (ISNT)</strong>.</p>
          <p style="text-align:left">IGCAR, the second largest establishment of the <strong>Department of Atomic Energy</strong> (DAE, <span><a href="http://www.dae.gov.in" target="_blank">http://www.dae.gov.in</a> ), is engaged in conducting broad based multidisciplinary programme of scientific research and advanced engineering, directed towards the development of sodium cooled Fast Reactors and associated fuel cycle technologies in India, with a special emphasis on various aspects of materials, manufacturing and structural integrity.</p>
          <p style="text-align:left"><strong>SFA</strong> serves as a national society to promote, encourage and develop the “Art and Science of Failure Analysis” and to stimulate interest in compilation of a database, for effective identification of root causes of failures and their prevention as well as to disseminate information concerning developments in related fields. SFA serves as a common platform for individuals, institutions, organizations and industries to exchange the rich experience of experts.</p>
          <p style="text-align:left"><strong>ISNT</strong> promotes the awareness of science and technology of non-destructive testing (NDT) through education, research and exchange of technical information within the country and abroad. The family of ISNT has more than 5000 members comprising of scientists, engineers, researchers, manufacturers and academicians. All dedicated to improve the product safety and reliability. These specialists represent virtually every industry and discipline that may benefit from NDT technology.</p>
          <p style="text-align:left"><strong>The Indian Institute of Metals (IIM)</strong> is a professional body representing the family of metallurgists and material scientists in India and has functioned over 70 years. The major objectives of IIM, comprising of over 10,000 members, is to promote the study and practice of science and technology of metals and alloys. The Institute carries out its activities through three divisions (Ferrous, Non-ferrous and Metal Sciences) and 52 chapters spanning across the country.</p>
          <p style="text-align:left"><strong>The Indian Structural Integrity Society (InSIS)</strong> is a professional society focusing on structural integrity with a multitude of interconnected disciplines that together determine safety, durability and robustness of everything that works and moves. It acts as the agency representing India to the International Congress on Fracture (ICF) through its executive.</p>
